I am driven by the vision of mitigating extreme weather events, such as typhoons, through the application of small, strategic perturbations. My research is multifaceted, with a core focus on understanding and influencing complex atmospheric phenomena. Key areas of interest include fluid dynamics in geophysical flows, turbulence, control of chaos in dynamical systems, and the integration of deep reinforcement learning with weather prediction models.

Our goal is to establish a leading lab in the field of weather controllability.
