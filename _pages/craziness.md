Freeman Dyson has expressed some thoughts on craziness in the realm of scientific innovation. In an article for Scientific American titled “Innovation in Physics,” he begins by recalling a story involving Niels Bohr and Wolfgang Pauli. During a lecture where Pauli presented a new theory of elementary particles, he faced significant criticism. Bohr summarized the sentiment by saying, “We are all agreed that your theory is crazy. The question which divides us is whether it is crazy enough to have a chance at being correct. My own feeling is that it is not crazy enough.”

Dyson added his insight, stating, “When the great innovation appears, it will almost certainly be in a muddled, incomplete, and confusing form. To the discoverer himself, it will be only half understood; to everybody else, it will be a mystery. For any speculation which does not at first glance look crazy, there is no hope.”
