## Join Our Team at Sichuan University!

### Opportunities
As I embark on founding my new lab at Sichuan University, I am actively seeking talented individuals to fill various roles:
- **Postdoctoral researchers**
- **Technicians**
- **Research assistants**
- **Students** at all levels (PhD, Master's, and Bachelor's) with a passion for geophysical fluid dynamics.

### We Offer
- A dynamic research environment at the forefront of weather controllability.
- Diverse projects ranging from theoretical studies to practical applications.
- Opportunities for innovation in the intersection of fluid dynamics, atmospheric science, and AI.

### We Value
- Strong skills in numerical simulations. Familiarity with weather systems is advantageous but not mandatory.
- Enthusiasm for tackling challenging problems in extreme weather mitigation.

Interested candidates are encouraged to send their CV, personal statement, and three references to `lin-li-scu@gmail.com`, specifying their primary and secondary research interests. Positions are available from May 2024.

## Research Opportunities

1. **Typhoon Controllability**
   Embrace our vision to control extreme weather through perturbations. We value expertise in numerical simulations, especially those involving the Navier-Stokes equations, and the ability to adapt and innovate within simulation frameworks. Knowledge in atmospheric science, chaos theory, or stability analysis is a plus.

2. **Predictive Control Systems**
   We aim to merge cutting-edge AI forecasting techniques (like GANs for immediate weather prediction) with advanced control methodologies (such as reinforcement learning) to develop predictive control systems for weather phenomena. Experience in machine learning, particularly GANs and reinforcement learning, is crucial. Familiarity with model-based reinforcement learning is advantageous.

3. **Pioneering Table-Top Typhoon Experiments**
   Bridging the gap between numerical simulations and physical experimentation, we seek to create the world's first laboratory-scale typhoon model. This requires a deep understanding of experimental fluid dynamics, proficiency with tools like LDV (Laser Doppler Velocimetry) and PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry), and ideally, knowledge of Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection or atmospheric dynamics.

Join us in our quest to advance the science of weather control and make significant contributions to mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events.
